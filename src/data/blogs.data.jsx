        Most fonts can be separated into a few categories. Notably,
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          Serif: these are the fonts that have decorative lapels on the letters,
          like you see on this website.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sans-serif: these fonts are more modern and rounded, without the
          lapels. They{" "}
          <span className="font-sans font-bold">look like this</span>. Here are
          some{" "}
          <a
            href="https://fonts.google.com/?stroke=Sans+Serif"
            target="_blank"

          >
            more examples
          </a>
          .
        </li>
        <br />
        Let’s focus on Sans-serif fonts. If you scroll through the{" "}
        <a
          href="https://fonts.google.com/?stroke=Sans+Serif"

          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Google Fonts page
        </a>{" "}
        with Sans-serif fonts, you’ll see that many of them have “Sans” in the
        name.

        Apple’s official font that they use for all of their software is called{" "}

        . It’s a Sans-serif font.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apple missed out on the opportunity to call it <i>Francisco Sans</i>.
        Wouldn’t that have been the best thing ever?
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          It’s clever, because you’re supposed to put “Sans” at the end of a
          Sans-serif font’s name anyway.
        </li>
        <li>It still maintains the meaning.</li>
        <li>It’s more memorable for people are knowledgable about fonts.</li>
