        <p>I live in a tower built on luck. </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Everything I’ve done that was successful, or can be considered
          successful, or led to other successes, was just me getting lucky.
          Nothing I’ve done required any kind of skill, intelligence, or hard
          work. Most people work harder than I do and don’t get to the places I
          get to. I just get lucky.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Maybe I can sit on this tower of luck for now. Maybe I can look out of
          its terraces through university, getting a job, maybe even a family
          and maybe even retirement. But one day, it will all catch up to me.
          One day this tower of luck will be brought down by the waves of
          justice to reveal not pillars of sandstone but just pillars of sand.
          My pitiful incompetency, laziness, unintelligence, and lack of passion
          will no longer support it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>But also, you&#39;re completely wrong.</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          By your logic, doesn&#39;t everything depend on luck? Wasn&#39;t it
          lucky that your parents decided to conceive you? That you,
          specifically, were conceived and not something else? Lucky that you
          didn&#39;t get aborted at birth or wasn&#39;t born in an iPhone
          factory where you would be hand-crafting iPhone 18s right now instead
          of complaining about your nonexistent problems?
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          Also, no, not everything you&#39;ve done was just purely luck based.
          Who do you feel like? How can you be so self-centered that you think
          the universe just happens to spin the Earth in the correct direction
          to make things go right for you?
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          You are incorrect in thinking that the only two options to achieve
          success are to get lucky or to work hard. In reality, the things that
          you&#39;ve done and the successes that you&#39;ve successed are a
          product of yours, and a bunch of other people&#39;s, combined effort.{" "}
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          And yes, Jeffrey, even if your weird self-centered way of thinking is
          correct, success does not come from luck alone. Let&#39;s say you are
          a potato farmer, and one day 500,000 potatoes randomly appear in your
          field. Even though you theoretically own all of these potatoes, they
          are just as useless to you as 500,000 pieces of dirt if you do not
          stand up, turn off your phone, get in the field and harvest them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Success is when ambition and hard work meet opportunity. Yes, you have
          gotten quite lucky. But you cannot forget that it requires competency,
          discipline, ambition, and hard work to notice when the luck comes by,
          and grab on for dear life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>You don&#39;t live in a tower built on luck.</p>
        <br />
        <p>You live in a tower made of 500,000 potatoes.</p>

        Most fonts can be separated into a few categories. Notably,
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          Serif: these are the fonts that have decorative lapels on the letters,
          like you see on this website.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Sans-serif: these fonts are more modern and rounded, without the
          lapels. They{" "}
          <span className="font-sans font-bold">look like this</span>. Here are
          some{" "}
          <a
            href="https://fonts.google.com/?stroke=Sans+Serif"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            more examples
          </a>
          .
        </ul>
        <br />
        Let’s focus on Sans-serif fonts. If you scroll through the{" "}
        <a
          href="https://fonts.google.com/?stroke=Sans+Serif"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Google Fonts page
        </a>{" "}
        with Sans-serif fonts, you’ll see that many of them have “Sans” in the
        name.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apple’s official font that they use for all of their software is called{" "}

        . It’s a Sans-serif font.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apple missed out on the opportunity to call it <i>Francisco Sans</i>.
        Wouldn’t that have been the best thing ever?
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          It’s clever, because you’re supposed to put “Sans” at the end of a
          Sans-serif font’s name anyway.
        </ul>
        <ul>It still maintains the meaning.</ul>
        <ul>It’s more memorable for people are knowledgeable about fonts.</ul>
